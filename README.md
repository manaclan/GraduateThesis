You can have a look at my thesis on the code page.  
In this thesis I tried to integrate CNN to extract optical flow in consecutive frames and smooth the trajectory with a averaging with coefficient filter called PAPS [1].  
Though my approach has showed to be a failure, I hope it will somehow contribute to later success in the future works.
